Comments on Code Quality: 

Coupling is rather high because the Player is passed 7 or 8 different types, but it may be necessary because the player interacts with mostly everything in the game. For that reason I would say the Cohesion is still high because the player only recieves what is necessary and nothing you would not expect the player to have.

Hypothetical Change: 

One change I might make would be to have the LinkLowHpColor() method increase HPFRAMES and in the if statements use the % operator for the logic instead of having to reset HPFRAMES in several times.
