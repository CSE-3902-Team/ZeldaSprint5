Comments on code quality:
	This is essentially just a container class that holds values from all parts of the game. From a user standpoint
	I think it would be easier to use the class if the class grouped the firstItem, itemInInventory, and Count variables into
	dictionaries that paired using enums.

Hypothetical Change: 
	What I said above would take a good amount of work and require refactoring over 30 lines of code elsewhere.
	At the end of the day it's more of a preference and doesn't really increase code quality too much, but it would cut down the size by half
