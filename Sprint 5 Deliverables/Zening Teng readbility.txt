This one is interesting, I can easily see that player death is seperate into different phases. First link will spin, then a start will show and blink. I think every part in 
this class is good, like undertandable variable and method names, flawless strucutre. There also some comments (like the comment at the bottom of SpinLink 
method) that can help readers understand what's happening here.
