Specific comments on what is maintainable and what is not:
	The constants in this code are great. Changing the code without these 13 constants would be a nightmare.
	I would suggest moving the rectangles in line 95 to be constants initalized with the class. It gives the rectangles
	better meaning.

Proposed change: Move the destinations rectangles in the draw loop to be constants. This would be a simple copy
paste and improve long term readability.
