Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
	-Line 342-345: These lines are almost 300 characters long. They should have variables inside of the draw method to shorten it and make it more obvious what each is. 

	-line 259-273: There is a huge whitespace in the middle of an if statement that should be removed. There is also tab errors in the if statement.

	-lines 10-53: similar variable types would be better grouped together. There are also variables initialized here but not used.
