Reflection: This sprint was not as hard as Sprint 3, but there were a lot of bugs that needed to be fixed, which required refactoring through out the entire sprint. We
fixed most if not all bugs that we had documented in Sprint 4. For this sprint, we added a 2 player mode, the darkroom effect, and a new boss. The most challenging part of implementation this sprint
was most likely the 2 player implementation, because we had to refactor a lot of our code to have a 2 player conditional. It also created a lot of bugs with collision and the inventory, which we had to fix
as well. The most straightforward thing to do was to create a new boss because all we had to do was add a new room, sprite, and some logic that was basically the same from the previous boss. 
One thing we will probably work on next sprint is to set deadlines for completion because we had to rush a lot more to finish our tasks. All we did was just assign tasks and told everyone to get it done before it was due, which brought up a lot of bugs when everyone
started test the game near the end of the sprint. This could have been easily avoided if the work was done sooner so we had more time to fix bugs.
